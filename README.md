## FAQ

#### Why use the discordJS library?

With Discord.js we managed to get some access information, in this way we send a webhook to a discord channel with some information.

#### What is this information?

Information obtained by the header on the deployment platform used, in this case, Versel.

Some are:
- public ip address
- access time
- theme
- visited links

#### What are you doing with this information?

Nothing more, they are only for the purpose of study and improvement of the project.
